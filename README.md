# Stargate

An open source data gateway.

Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a database.
CQL is built with extensibility as a first-class citizen, which makes it easy to use a database for any application workload
by adding plugin support for new APIs, data types, and access methods.

## Introduction

We created Stargate because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done.
With "read the manual" fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we started a new project, we thought - *why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads?*

This project enables customization of all aspects of data access and has modules for authentication, APIs, request handling / routing, and persistence backends.
The current form is specific to the Apache Cassandra (C*) backend but there's no bounds to the databases or APIs that this framework can support.

As shown in the figure below, Stargate is often deployed behind a load balancer or proxy and exposes multiple endpoints to client applications, including HTTP APIs, gRPC, and the Cassandra Query Language (CQL). Stargate sits in front of a Cassandra cluster which is used as the storage backend.

Stargate consists of the following components, which we introduce briefly here with links to the corresponding modules in this monorepo.

### API Services
These are independently scalable microservices which various APIs, typically HTTP based. These modules can be found under the [apis](apis) directory: 

- [sgv2-restapi](apis/sgv2-restapi): API implementation for exposing Cassandra data over REST
- [sgv2-graphqlapi](apis/sgv2-graphqlapi): API implementation for exposing Cassandra data over GraphQL
- [sgv2-docsapi](apis/sgv2-docsapi): API implementation for exposing Cassandra data over a Document API

Each API Service contains its own integration test suite that tests it against the coordinator node and supported Cassandra backends. There is also a [sgv2-quarkus-common](apis/sgv2-quarkus-common) module containing utilities that may be used by all Java/Quarkus based API services.

### Coordinator Node
Coordinator nodes participate as non-data storing nodes in the backing Cassandra cluster, which enables them to read and write data more efficiently. Stargate Coordinator nodes can also be scaled independently. Coordinator nodes expose gRPC and CQL interfaces for fast access by client applications. The following are the key modules comprising the coordinator and its exposed interfaces:

- [core](core): Common classes used throughout the other coordinator modules
- [cql](cql): API implementation for the Cassandra Query Language
- [grpc](grpc): fast CQL over gRPC implementation (HTTP-based interface equivalent to CQL performance)
- [bridge](bridge): gRPC-based interface used by API services
- [health-checker](core): HTTP endpoints useful for health checking coordinator nodes
- [metrics-jersey](core): metrics collection for the coordinator node and its exposed interfaces
- [stargate-starter](stargate-starter): the main Java application used to start the coordinator via the `starctl` script

#### Persistence Services
Stargate coordinator nodes support a pluggable approach for implementing the coordination layer to execute requests passed by API services and other interfaces to underlying data storage instances. Persistence service implementations are responsible handling and converting requests to database queries, dispatching to a specific version of Cassandra, and returning and serving responses.

- [persistence-api](persistence-api): Interface for working with persistence services 
- [persistence-common](persistence-common): Utilities shared by the persistence services
- [persistence-cassandra-3.11](persistence-cassandra-3.11): Joins C* 3.11 cluster as coordinator-only node (does not store data)
mocks C* system tables for native driver integration,
executes requests with C* storage nodes using C* QueryHandler/QueryProcessor,
converts internal C* objects and ResultSets to Stargate Datastore objects.
- [persistence-cassandra-4.0](persistence-cassandra-4.0): (same as above but for Cassandra 4.0)
- [persistence-dse-6.8](persistence-dse-6.8): (same as above but for DataStax Enterprise 6.8)

#### Authentication and Authorization Services
Stargate coordinator nodes also support a pluggable authentication and authorization approach.

- [authnz](authnz): Interface for working with auth providers
- [auth-api](auth-api): REST service for generating auth tokens
- [auth-table-based-service](auth-table-based-service): Service to store tokens in the database
- [auth-jtw-based-service](auth-jwt-based-service): Service to authenticate using externally generated JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

#### Coordinator Node Testing
The following modules provide support for testing:

- [testing](testing): Integration test suite for the coordinator node modules
- [persistence-test](persistence-test): Common utilities for testing persistence services

Instructions for running and extending the test suite can be found in the [developer guide](DEV_GUIDE.md).

## Repositories

Here is an overview of the key repositories in the Stargate GitHub organization:
