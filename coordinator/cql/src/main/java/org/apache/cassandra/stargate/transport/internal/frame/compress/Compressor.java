/**
 * Analogous to {@link org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.ICompressor}, but different enough that it's
 * worth specializing:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>disk IO is mostly oriented around ByteBuffers, whereas with Frames raw byte arrays are
 *       primarily used
 *   <li>our LZ4 compression format is opionated about the endianness of the preceding length bytes,
 *       big for protocol, little for disk
 *   <li>ICompressor doesn't make it easy to pre-allocate the output buffer/array
 * </ul>
 *
 * In future it may be worth revisiting to unify the interfaces.
